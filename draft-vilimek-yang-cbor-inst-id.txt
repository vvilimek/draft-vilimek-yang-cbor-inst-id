1.  Introduction

   The RFC 9254 Encoding Rules of Data Modeled with YANG in the Concise
   Binary Object Representation (CBOR) does not define encoding rules
   for 'instance-identifier' pointing to list without keys entry
   instances and instances of leaf-list entries.  The goal of this
   document is to define the missing rules and make clarifications in
   the used terminology.

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defiend in [RFC7950]:

   *  list

   *  leaf-list

   *  leaf

   *  container

   *  instance-identifier

   The following term is defined in [RFC8949]:

   *  data item

   The following terms are defined in [RFC9254]:

   *  delta (of YANG SIDs)

   *  absolute SID

   The following terms are defined in [RFC9595]:

   *  item

   *  YANG Schema Item iDentifier (or "YANG SID" or simply "SID")

   Note that the [RFC9254] also define term YANG Schema Item iDentifier
   but the definition describe the same term.

   TODO: use the "The following terms are used within this document:"
   header?

   Keyless list:  Is config false YANG list without any keys.

   Keyed list:  Is YANG list that is not a keyless list.  It is either a
      config true list or config false list with at least one key.

   Single instance node:  Is a instance node with at most one possible
      instantiation.  Instantiations of top-level containers are single
      instance nodes, instantiations of leafs of toplevel containers are
      single instance nodes.  Container and leaf instantiations of
      single instance node are also single instance nodes.  No list or
      leaf-list entries are single instance nodes, even if they have
      max-elements equal to one.  If instance is a child of list entry
      it is not a single instance node.  Note that this term is defined
      so that set of instance nodes that are uniquely identified by only
      YANG Schema Item iDentifier and set of single instance nodes are
      the same set.

3.  Representing YANG 'instance-identifier' Type in CBOR

3.1.  SIDs as 'instance-identifier'

   The definitions of Section 6.13.1 of [RFC9254] applies with following
   exceptions:

   The encoding rules for list apply only for keyed lists.

   In the case of a representation node that is an entry of a keyless
   list, a SID is combined with the list entry index is used to identify
   each instance within the keyless list.  The index MUST be encoded
   using CBOR unsigned integer data item (major type 0).  The index MUST
   be 1-base to keep same indexing base as RESTCONF [RFC8040] and
   NETCONF [RFC6241].

   Instance-identifier of an instance that is not single instance node
   MUST be encoded using a CBOR array item (major type 4) containing the
   following CBOR data items:

   *  The first element MUST be encoded as a CBOR unsigned integer data
      item (major type 0) and set to the targeted schema node SID.  No
      delta mechanism for SID is used.

   *  The next elements MUST contain the value of each key required to
      identify the instance of the targeted schema node.  These keys
      MUST be ordered as defined in the 'key' YANG statement for keyed
      list.  The keys are encoded according the rules defined in
      [RFC9254] and this document.  If the list is keyless list the key
      MUST be encoded using the CBOR unsigned integer data item (major
      type 0) as specified in this document.  The order of the keys and
      indices MUST be same as walk from top-level node down to targeted
      schema node.

   *  If the instance is leaf-list entry, the last element MUST be
      encoded according to encoding rules defined in [RFC9254] and this
      document.

   This means that instance-identifier identifing a leaf-list instance
   with single instance node parent will result in a CBOR array with two
   elements, the SID as CBOR unsigned integer and leaf-list value
   representation.

   TODO: is this a good solution?

   The YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] allows leaf-list of state data to have
   duplicates.  In this case, it is not defined which element the
   instance-identifier identifies.

3.1.1.  Examples

   Definition example adapted from [RFC7950]:

   container system {
     ...
     leaf reporting-entity {
       type instance-identifier;
     }
   }

   YANG model code snippet used for second and third example:

   container auth {
     leaf-list foreign-user {
       type string;
     }
   }

   All examples are considered to live inside the example module
   namespace if not stated otherwise.  Equivalent representation using
   the Names encoding may help readers already familiar with YANG JSON
   encoding [RFC7951], or similar XML encoding defined in YANG 1.1
   [RFC7950].

   _First example:_

   The following example shows the encoding of the 'reporting-entity'
   value referencing 'neighbor-sysid" (which is assumed to have SID
   68000) of keyless "/isis:adjacencies/adjacency" list's second list
   entry.  The example is adapted from [RFC9130] and therefore uses the
   isis namespace:

   // in module isis
   container adjacencies {
     config false;
     list adjacency {
       leaf neighbor-sysid {
         type string;
       }
       leaf more-data {
         type binary;
       }
     }
   }

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [ 68000, 2 ]

   CBOR encoding: 82 # array(2) 1A 000109A0 # 68000 02 # 2

   Equivalent instance-identifier encoded using the Names:
   "/isis:adjacencies/adjacency[.=2]/neighbor-sysid"

   _Second example:_

   The following example shows the encoding of the 'reporting-entity'
   value referencing leaf-list instance "/auth/foreign-user" (which is
   assumed to have SID 60000) entry "alice".

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [ 60000, "alice" ]

   CBOR encoding: 82 # array(2) 19 F6F6 # unsigned(60000) 65 # text(5)
   616c696365 # "alice"

   Equivalent instance-identifier encoded using the Names:
   "/example:auth/foreigh-user[.="alice"]"

   _Third example:_

   The following example show the encoding of the 'reporting-entity'
   value referencing leaf-list instance "/auth/foreign-user" (SID
   60000).

   CBOR diagnostic notation: 60000

   CBOR encoding: 19 F6F6

   Equivalent instance-identifier encoded using the Names:
   "/example:auth/foreigh-user"

   _Fourth example:_

   The following example shows the encoding of the 'reporting-entity'
   value referencing leaf-list instance "/user-group/user" (which is
   assumed to have SID 61000) entry "eve" for group-name "restricted".

   list user-group {
     config true;
     key "group-name"

     leaf group-name {
       type string;
     }

     leaf-list user {
       type string;
     }
   }

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [ 61000, "restricted", "eve" ]

   CBOR encoding: 83 # array(3) 19 EE48 # 61000 6A # text(10)
   72657374726963746564 # "resricted" 63 # text(3) 657665 # "eve"

   Equivalent instance-identifier encoded using the Names:
   "/example:user-group[group-name="restricted"]/user[.="eve"]"

   _Fifth example:_

   The following example shows the encoding of 'reporting-entity' value
   referencing leaf-list instance "/user-group/user" for group name
   "restricted".

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [ 61000, "restricted" ]

   CBOR encoding: 83 # array(3) 19 EE48 # 61000 6A # text(10)
   72657374726963746564 # "resricted"

   Equivalent instance-identifier encoded using the Names:
   "/example:user-group[group-name="restricted"]"

   Note that this encoding is same as if the node user was a leaf.

   _Sixth example:_

   The following example shows the encoding of 'reporting-entity' value
   referencing leaf-list instance "/working-group/chair" entry.  This
   entry references "/auth/foreign-user" leaf-list entry "John Smith".
   The "/working-group/chair" is assumed to have SID 62000.

   list working-group {
     leaf name {
       type string;
     }

     leaf-list chair {
       type instance-identifier;
     }
   }

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [ 62000, "core", [ 60000, "John Smith" ] ]

   CBOR encoding: 83 # array(3) 19 F230 # 62000 64 # text(4) 636F7265 #
   "core" 82 # array(2) 19 F6F6 # 60000 6A # text(10)
   4a6f686e20536d697468 # "John Smith"

   Equivalent instance-identifier encoded using the Names:
   "/example:working-group[name="core"]/chair=[.="/example:auth/foreign-
   user[.="John Smith"]"]

   TODO longer chains of leaf-list instance-identifier lead to high
   nesting of the CBOR array data items.  Shoul a cap for the contrained
   nodes by put to simplify the implementations?  I think cap around 8
   should be suffient for most deployments.  I think that using leaf-
   list instance-identifier chaining is not a good practise.

   _Seventh example:_

   The following exampke shows the encoding of 'reporting-entity' value
   referencing leaf 'token-data' of device with 'id' "id01", first
   'security' list entry for user's 'bob' second 'access-token' list
   entry.  The leaf 'token-data' is assumed to have SID 61500.

   list device {
     key "id";

     leaf id {
       type string;
     }

     list security {
       config false;

       list user {
         key "name";
         leaf name;

         list access-token {
           leaf type {
             type identityref { base token; }
           }
           leaf token-data {
             type binary;
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }

   identity token;

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [ 61500, "id01", 1, "bob", 2 ]

   CBOR encoding: 84 # array(4) 19 F03C # 61500 64 # text(4) 69643031 #
   "id01" 01 # 1 63 # text(3) 626F62 # "bob" 02 # 2

   Equivalent instance-identifier encoded using the Names:
   "/example:device[id="id01"]/security[.=1]/user[user="bob"]/access-
   token[.=2]/token-data"

4.  Content-Types

   TODO Is it possible to reuse the Content-types define in the
   [RFC9254]?  It would be wasteful to assign new MIME content-type
   basically the same format.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8949], [RFC7950], [RFC9254] and
   [RFC9595] apply.

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

   TODO Is it possible to keep the same IANA allocations of th
   [RFC9254]?  This draft wants to be more of a bugfix document than new
   encoding scheme.
