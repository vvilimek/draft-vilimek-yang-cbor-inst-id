   Encoding rules of YANG 'instance-identifier' in the Concise Binary
                      Object Representation (CBOR)
                 draft-vilimek-yang-cbor-inst-id-latest

Abstract

   The RFC 9254 Encoding Rules of Data Modeled with YANG in the Concise
   Binary Object Representation (CBOR) does not define some aspects of
   the encoding.  Goal of this document is to fill in the gaps in the
   RFC 9254.  These gaps appear in encoding rules for YANG 'instance-
   identifier' data type.

1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defiend in [RFC7950]:

   *  list

   *  list entry

   *  leaf-list

   *  leaf-list entry

   *  container

   *  instance-identifier

   The following term is defined in [RFC8949]:

   *  data item

   The following terms are defined in [RFC9254]:

   *  delta (of YANG SIDs)

   *  absolute SID

   The following terms are defined in [RFC9595]:

   *  item

   *  YANG Schema Item iDentifier (or "YANG SID" or simply "SID")

   Keyless list:  Is config false YANG list without any keys.

   Keyed list:  Is YANG list that is not a keyless list.  It is either a
      config true list or config false list with at least one key.

   Note that keyless list might be inside keyed list but not vice versa.
   Keyless list might be inside another keyless list, same thing holds
   for keyed lists.

   Single instance node:  Is a instance node with at most one possible
      instantiation.  Instantiations of top-level containers are single
      instance nodes, instantiations of leafs of toplevel containers are
      single instance nodes.  No list or leaf-list entries are single
      instance nodes, even if they have max-elements equal to one.  If
      instance is a child of list entry it is not a single instance
      node.  Note that is term is defined so that set of instance nodes
      that are uniquely identified by only YANG Schema Item iDentifier
      and set of single instance nodes are the same set.

3.  Representing YANG 'instance-identifier' Type in CBOR

3.1.  SIDs as 'instance-identifier'

   The definitions of Section 6.13.1 of [RFC9254] applies with following
   exceptions:

   The encoding rules defined in the [RFC9254] for list apply only to
   keyed lists.

   In the case of a representation node that is an entry of a keyless
   list, a SID is combined with the list entry index is used to identify
   each instance within the keyless list.  The index MUST be encoded
   using CBOR unsigned integer data item (major type 0).  The index is
   1-base to keep same indexing base as RESTCONF [RFC8040] and NETCONF
   [RFC6241].

   Instance-identifier of leaf-list entry with single instance parent
   MUST be encoded using a two-element CBOR array item (major type 4)
   containing the following CBOR data items:

   *  The first element MUST be encoded as a CBOR unsigned integer data
      item (major type 0) and set to the targeted schema node SID.

   *  The second element MUST be encoding of the leaf-list entry value
      as defined by this document or as defined by [RFC9254].

   Instance-identifier of leaf-list with single instance node parent
   MUST be encoded using a CBOR unsigned integer set to targeted schema
   node SID.

   Instance-identifier of leaf-list entry, if entry's parent is not a
   single instance node, MUST be encoded using a CBOR array data item
   (major type 4) containing the following entries:

   *  The first entry array MUST be encoded as a CBOR unsigned integer
      data item (major type 0) and set to the targeted schema node SID.

   *  The following entries MUST contain the value of each key required
      to identify the instance of the targeted schema node.  These keys
      MUST be ordered as defined in the 'key' YANG statement, staring
      from the top-level list, and the followed by each subordinate
      lists(s).

   *  The last entry MUST be encoded according to rules defined for the
      targeted node data type.  These rules are defined in [RFC9254].

   Instance-identifier of leaf-list with parent that is not a single
   instance node MUST be encoded using a CBOR array data item (major
   type 4) containing the following entries:

   *  The first entry MUST be encoded as a CBOR unsigned integer data
      item (major type 0) and set to the targeted schema node SID.

   *  The following entries MUST contain the value of each key required
      to identify the instance of the targeted schema node.  These keys
      MUST be ordered as defined in the 'key' YANG statement, starting
      from the top-level list, and follow by each subordinate list(s).

   Definition example adapted from [RFC7950]:

   container system {
     ...
     leaf reporting-entity {
       type instance-identifier;
     }
   }

   YANG model code snippet used for second and third example:

   container auth {
     leaf-list foreign-user {
       type string;
     }
   }

   _First example:_ The following example shows the encoding of the
   'reporting-entity' value referencing keyless list "/adjacencies/
   adjacency" (which is assumed to have SID 68000) for second list
   entry.  The example adapted from [RFC9130]:

   container adjacencies {
     config false;
     list adjacency {
       leaf neighbor-sysid {
         type string;
       }
     }
   }

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [68000, 2]

   CBOR encoding: ~~~ cbor-pretty 82 # array(2) 1A 000109A0 # 68000 02 #
   2 ~~~

   The equivalent RESTCONF resource identifier is "".

   _Second example:_

   The following example shows the encoding of the 'reporting-entity'
   value referencing leaf-list instance "/auth/foreign-user" (which is
   assumed to have SID 60000) entry "alice".

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [ 60000, "alice" ]

   CBOR encoding: ~~~ cbor-pretty 82 # array(2) 19 F6F6 #
   unsigned(60000) 65 # text(5) 616c696365 # "alice" ~~~

   _Third example:_

   The following example show the encoding of the 'reporting-entity'
   value referencing leaf-list instance "/auth/foreign-user" (SID
   60000).

   CBOR diagnostic notation: 60000

   CBOR encoding: 19 F6F6

   _Fourth example:_ The following example shows the encoding of the
   'reporting-entity' value referencing leaf-list instance "/user-group/
   user" (which is assumed to have SID 61000) entry "eve" for group-name
   "restricted".

   list user-group {
     config true;
     key "name"

     leaf group-name {
       type string;
     }

     leaf-list user {
       type string;
     }
   }

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [ 61000, "restricted", "eve" ]

   CBOR encoding: ~~~ cbor-pretty 83 # array(3) 19 EE48 # 61000 6A #
   text(10) 72657374726963746564 # "resricted" 63 # text(3) 657665 #
   "eve" ~~~

   _Fifth example:_

   The following example shows the encoding of 'reporting-entity' value
   referencing leaf-list instance "/user-group/user" for group name
   "restricted".

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [ 61000, "restricted" ]

   CBOR encoding: ~~~ cbor-pretty 83 # array(3) 19 EE48 # 61000 6A #
   text(10) 72657374726963746564 # "resricted" ~~~

   Note that this encoding is same as if the node user was a leaf.

   _Sixth example:_

   The following example shows the encoding of 'reporting-entity' value
   referencing leaf-list instance "/working-group/chair" entry.  This
   entry references "/auth/foreign-user" leaf-list entry "John Smith".
   The "/working-group/chair" is assumed to have SID 62000.

   list working-group {
     leaf name {
       type string;
     }

     leaf-list chair {
       type instance-identifier;
     }
   }

   CBOR diagnostic notation: [ 62000, "core", [ 60000, "John Smith" ] ]

   CBOR encoding: ~~~ cbor-pretty 83 # array(3) 19 F230 # 62000 64 #
   text(4) 636F7265 # "core" 82 # array(2) 19 F6F6 # 60000 6A # text(10)
   4a6f686e20536d697468 # "John Smith" ~~~

4.  Content-Types

   TODO check again that application/yang-data+cbor id=sid may not use
   instance-identifier encoded using Names Section 6.13.2 of [RFC9254].

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8949], [RFC7950], [RFC9254] and
   [RFC9595] apply.

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   TODO note about changes (unfortunately this document will have an
   IANA action)
