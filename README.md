# Encoding rules of YANG 'intance-identifier' in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)

We strive to update the RFC 9254 Encoding of Data Modeled with YANG in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR).

The goal of this draft is to define rules of previously left out cases. These cases include:
 - encoding rules for leaf-list entries
 - encoding rules for keyless list entries 

If you have any suggestion or comment, please feel free to create an issue or pull request.
